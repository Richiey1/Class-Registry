# Class Registration DApp

This is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum for registering and managing student records using smart contracts.

The front-end is built with React and Material UI, and the smart contract is written in Solidity.

## Features

- **Register Students**: Admin can register students by providing a unique student ID and name.
- **Remove Students**: Admin can remove students from the registry by providing the student ID.
- **Fetch Student Details**: Anyone can fetch the details of a student using their student ID.
- **Connect Wallet**: The DApp allows users to connect their wallet to interact with the smart contract.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For writing the smart contract.
- **React**: Front-end for building the DApp interface.
- **Material UI**: For UI components and styling.
- **Ethers.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Vite**: Build tool for development and production.
